            <h2><kbd>About Connection</kbd></h2>
            <h4> Connection is a new social media platform, where you can find what's happening in your neighbourhood
                and connect
                with others based on the activities(BUZZ) happening.<br> Connection can be used from finding the 11th
                player
                of Cricket team for your cricket match with friends at local park, to getting notified of the little Rap
                battle happening in your college campus.<br><br>
                It is a <i>Instant</i>, <i>Localised</i> and <i>Private</i> platform for interaction.<br><br> Aims to
                decrease the need for the
                Blue
                screen(Mobile Phone) and increase the real world social connections enjoyed in real world environment.
            </h4>
            <h4>In one sentence if we have to describe connection, it would be <br> <br> <em><strong> "twitter for you
                neighbourhood! where you don't just share your emotions but make new connections alongside strengthening
                the
                old ones you have with the help of day to day
                activities on Connection application platform."</strong></em></h4>
            <br>


            <h3><kbd>Why we need Connection?</kbd></h3>
            <h4>Covid has created a situation where we are forced to stay inside the house and interact with one another
                using just blue screen.
                As the covid restrains are getting removed, people need a new way to bring back that physical
                interaction that
                supposed to be happen with minimum use of blue screen. That's what Connection does.
                <br> <br>
                Also the Current social media platform are exploiting the present situation to move whole physical
                social interaction behind the blue screen, just for the benefit to generate more revenue, which is
                leading to depression, loneliness, body shaming, etc. kind of problems.
